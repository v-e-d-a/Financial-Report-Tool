Developed a comprehensive financial reporting tool in Python that automates the retrieval, analysis, and reporting of financial and economic data from the World Bank API. 
The tool integrates data fetching to analyze GDP and other economic indicators across multiple countries, 
automates the calculation of key financial metrics such as GDP growth rates, and generates professional financial reports in Excel and PDF formats. 


Future Scope of the Project
The Financial Reporting Tool has significant potential for further development. Here are some areas where you could expand or improve the project:

1. Integration with More Data Sources
Enhance Data Variety: Integrate additional economic and financial data sources, such as IMF, OECD, or stock market data, to provide a broader range of insights.
Real-Time Data: Implement real-time data fetching and updating, enabling more current analysis and reporting.

2.  User Interface (UI) Development
Web-Based Dashboard: Create a user-friendly web interface using frameworks like Flask or Django, allowing users to interact with the tool online and generate custom reports.
Interactive Reports: Develop interactive reports using tools like Plotly or Dash, enabling users to drill down into specific data points or customize their views.

4. Scalability and Performance
Cloud Integration: Deploy the tool on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud to handle large datasets and offer the tool as a service (SaaS).
Big Data Processing: Utilize big data technologies like Apache Spark or Hadoop to manage and process vast amounts of financial data efficiently.
